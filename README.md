# Cloud Infrastructure Project – Google Cloud & Apache

## Overview
This project was completed as part of an Information Technology Infrastructure course.
The objective was to gain hands-on experience with cloud computing, virtual machines,
and web server deployment.

## Technologies Used
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Ubuntu Linux
- Apache HTTP Server
- HTML / CSS (static website)

## Project Description
In this project, I created a virtual machine instance on Google Cloud Platform using
an Ubuntu operating system. After configuring the environment, I installed and set up
the Apache HTTP Server to host a static website.

The deployed website presents information about the **Gartner Magic Quadrant** and was
made publicly accessible through the cloud instance.

## What I Did
- Created and configured a **Google Cloud VM instance**
- Set up an **Ubuntu** environment
- Installed and configured **Apache web server**
- Uploaded and hosted a static website
- Verified deployment via public IP access

## Key Learnings
- Fundamentals of cloud infrastructure and virtual machines
- Working with Linux-based operating systems
- Web server installation and configuration
- Understanding how cloud resources serve web applications

## Notes
This is a beginner-level, hands-on project focused on learning cloud infrastructure
concepts rather than production-level deployment.
